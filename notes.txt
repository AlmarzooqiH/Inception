For the SSL certificate and key generation, I used the following command:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout conf/ssl/nginx.key -out conf/ssl/nginx.crt

Here is what each option means:

-x509 → generates a self-signed certificate
-nodes → no passphrase (so Nginx can start without needing a password)
-days 365 → certificate is valid for 1 year
-newkey rsa:2048 → generate a 2048-bit RSA key
-keyout → specifies the output file for the private key
-out → specifies the output file for the certificate
